# Media-Organizer
A homemade script for sorting photos based on modification date, 
Sorts a source dir into a destiantion dir.

Will group photos into directories based on this format `YYYY-MM`

Photo name will be of this format `DD--HH-MM-SS.ext`

If the photo is a duplicate or a burst will append `dupN` or `burstN`
